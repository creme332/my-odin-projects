# To-do
* [ ] Add more characters/map + maps
* [ ] Add difficulty rating to each character and rework formula for score calculation
* [ ] Add on-screen alert when correct character is clicked so that player does not have to scroll up to check if correct.
* [ ] Add a private subcollection for each `user`. This will be accessible only to 1 user.
* [ ] Add more authentication methods
* [x] Generate production build
* [x] Use pageInsight to test website after deployment.

## Optimizations 

* [ ] Use redux for state management
  + when website first loads, make 1 request for user data. serve this data throughout web. when data changes, update stored state first then send changes to firestore. 
  + this prevents delay for fetching data for profile page each time it is clicked
* [ ] Rework method of setting characters. Do not save separate images for each character. Use image of map and coordinates to obtain character image dynamically
* [ ] Rewrite everything in typescript

##  Extra features

* [ ] Add a map creator page where user can upload their own maps, crop characters and upload it to firestore. Use [`Cropper.js`](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/).
* [ ] add tour of website (reacttour)
* [ ] add animation for showing character images - card animation
