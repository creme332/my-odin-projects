## How to create your own maps

1. Update mapProvider but keep character list empty for now.
2. Add a background colour and an outline to Hitbox element.
3. Add a Hitbox element to TransformWrapper and manually modify its leftPos and topPos to move the hitbox element where needed
4. With live reload enabled and some trial and error, you will easily place the hitbox where needed. 
5. Update mapProvider.
