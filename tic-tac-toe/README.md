Play 3D Tic-Tac-Toe on a 4x4x4 grid. Players take turns placing their markers in blank cells in the array. The first player to place four of their own markers in a line wins. The winning line can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal on a single board as in regular tic-tac-toe, or vertically in a column, or a diagonal line through four boards.
