# Shopping Cart ðŸ›’
A prototype e-commerce website for an eco-friendly banana chip business. The design was inspired by [dbraden](https://www.figma.com/@dbraden).

> âš  Since this website uses `BrowserRouter` which is not supported by Github Pages, reloading a page or accessing a page (other than home page) directly  through its URL will cause a 404 error. I deliberately chose not to [fix this issue with `HashRouter`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71984401/react-router-not-working-with-github-pages) for simplicity.
