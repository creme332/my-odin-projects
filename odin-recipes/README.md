# To-do
- [ ] Make design [responsive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na-X_SM8vg0&ab_channel=ColtSteele). Currently home page and recipe page do not render properly on small screen sizes. (title moves out of box, columns get shrinked, ...)
- [ ] Fix `Drinks` images. Images on homepage should be approximately the same size.
- [ ] Add a "Go back" button on recipe pages.
- [ ] Make `View Recipe` appear in middle of image on hover.
- [ ] Clicking on image instead of `View Recipe` should lead to recipe page.
- [ ] Try to convert into a Progressive Web App
# Done
- [x] Fix favicon 
- [x] Make CSS 2-column [card](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_two_columns_responsive) for recipes
- [x] Try animated CSS [cards](https://fireship.io/lessons/css-cards-animated/) (NOT USED)
