# ðŸ•¶ Usage
### `buildTree` 
Takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree. Returns the root node.

> âš  Duplicates are removed from the array.

### `insert` 
Inserts a node to the binary tree.

### `delete`
Deletes a node from the binary tree.

###  a `find` function which 
Accepts a value and returns the node with the given value.

### `levelOrder`, `recursiveLevelOrder`
Traverses the tree in breadth-first level order and returns an array of values.

###  `inorder`, `preorder`, and `postorder`
Each of these functions traverses the tree in their respective depth-first order and returns an array of values.

### `height` 
Accepts a node and returns its height. Height is defined as the number of edges in longest path from a given node to a leaf node.

### `depth`
Accepts a node and returns its depth. Depth is defined as the number of edges in path from a given node to the treeâ€™s root node.

###  `isBalanced`
Checks if the tree is balanced. A balanced tree is one where the difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree of every node is not more than 1.

### `rebalance`  
Rebalances an unbalanced tree. 

### `prettyPrint`
Prints tree to console.

### `invert`
Left and right children of all non-leaf nodes are interchanged. 

> âš  You must rebalance the tree before performing any tree operations (insert, delete, find) on the inverted tree.
