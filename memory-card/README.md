# Memory Card ðŸ§ 

Memory Card Game is a classic card game where players are required to match pairs of cards. The game involves a set of cards with identical pairs of images that are shuffled and placed face-down. The player then turns over two cards at a time, attempting to match pairs by remembering the location of cards on the board.
